# Cat or Not
The goal being to have small images from a camera hooked to an ESP32 to
detect if a cat is in front of it or not.

Based on https://github.com/tensorflow/tflite-micro/blob/main/tensorflow/lite/micro/examples/person_detection/training_a_model.md

The paper explicitly states the use case even! https://arxiv.org/pdf/1906.05721

Look at https://github.com/sebug/downsample to easily simulate what the
camera will see.

Maybe use https://explore.org/livecams/kitten-rescue/kitten-rescue-cam to
detect cat presence
